                How will my plant arrive?

            <div class="answer-text">
                Our number one priority is that our plants arrive in happy, healthy condition. 
                Some of our plants ship directly potted in our earthenware plants, while others 
                ship in their nursery grow pot placed inside the planter. How each plant ships is 
                noted on its product page.

                Why does my plant look different than it does on the website?
            </div>
            <div class="answer-text">
                Live plants and small batch pottery will have variations in color, texture, finish, and size. 
                While we make every effort to display our potted plants as accurately as possible, there may 
                be subtle differences from what is displayed online.

            <div class="question-heading">
                My plant arrived damaged. What do I do?
            </div>
            <div class="answer-text">
                Every plant is fragile and the shipping process is not always kind (or easy). Most of the time we 
                get it right, but sometimes we don’t. When that happens, we fix it – be it a damaged plant or pot 
                due to shipping carrier mishandling. Please inspect your package when you receive your delivery. 
                Should your order arrive damaged, please fill out our contact form (make sure to include a photo) 
                and we’ll get back to you in two business days. The form ensures we have what’s needed to help you 
                as soon as possible!

                In the unlikely event a plant is received dead on arrival, it will always be replaced.
