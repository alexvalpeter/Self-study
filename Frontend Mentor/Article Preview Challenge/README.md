# Frontend Mentor - Article Preview Component Challenge

This is my coded solution to the Article Preview Challenge from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT)


### The Challenge

- Users should be able to view the optimal layout for both desktop and mobile devices using 1440px and 375px viewport widths respectively.
- See active hover states for all interactive elements


### Built With
- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS3
- Vanila JavaScript
