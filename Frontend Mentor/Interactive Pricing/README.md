# Frontend Mentor - Interactive Pricing Component Challenge

This is my coded solution to the Interactive Pricing Component Challenge from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8)

### The Challenge
 - Replicate the design using best visual approximations of measurements (no explicit element positioning or dimesions given) 
- Users should be able to view the optimal layout for both desktop and mobile devices using 1440px and 375px viewport widths respectively.
- See active hover states for all interactive elements
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers
- Apply discount to all prices when "yearly billing" is toggled on


### Built With
- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
